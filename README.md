Spring AI pet project

Lately I have been studying Spring AI and in this project I have applied all my knowledge that I have gained recently.

In this project I use such LLM technologies and specifications as:
1. Setting up Spring AI and creating a simple API using AI (As LLM I used the free version of Llama)
2. Prompt engineering (using different ways of writing queries in AI)
3. RAG retrieval-augment generation.
4. RAG Expert (Writing more complex queries and obtaining relevant information)
5. Connecting specific sites to search for the necessary information and setting up LLM for a specific case.
6. Setting up Milvus to store created vectors and obtain documents based on similar vectors in the Milvus vector database
